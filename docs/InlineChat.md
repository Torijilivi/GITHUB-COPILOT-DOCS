## Inline Chat and its Prompts ##

Inline commands are used inside the editor for referring to specific parts of the code easily, or just for using the file we are working with as context.

It works like the Copilot chat, but there are some tags you can't use, and others are exclusive to this function.

Furthermore, it is capable of modifying your code directly so you don't have to.

# Providing intention #

We can use '/' to give details about the intention we have when we are writing a prompt, in other words, the result we want to get.

***/doc***

This tag will focus in commenting the code automatically according to the requirements you specify in the prompt.
