# Introduction #

We can use GitHub Copilot to generate documentation, for example:
- Project requirements
- Project constraints
- Project architecture
- Project design
- Project testing
- Project deployment
- Project summary

There are two ways to communicate with Copilot.

- *Copilot Chat*: Working with copilot like a chatbot oriented to code, with the ability to create files, projects, documentation and many other things.

- *Inline Chat*: Including copilot in our code, modyfing and coding it.

It both situations, we must learn how to use prompts to communicate with them as precisely as possible.

To complete this task more efficiently and get a better response from the AI, we should use the tools we have, which are the tags in prompts. These are keywords that help to create more understandable prompts for Copilot.

These tags may be useful for providing context, referring to specific files, or expressing your goal and desired answer, as well as for other tasks.

We can write prompts, and Copilot will interpret them to return the result we asked for.
